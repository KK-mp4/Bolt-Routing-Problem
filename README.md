# Piton Bolt Network Routing Problem (work in progress)
## Different algorithms for connecting stations in a piston bolt network

With all the new development in [piston bolt tech](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI-RNUGw-AeRkX7MQm9ArljzVCuuSzg0y) old servers might consider rebuilding their piston bolt network in the nether.

When you already know where the stations will be it is an interesting [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization) problem of how to connect all stations with piston bolts in a way that your system is **both easy** to build (has least piston bolt length) **and fast** (smallest piston bolt travel time). I was always sleeping at [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) lectures, so I'm not saying that this is good stuff I coded in here

For all the calculations I will use coordinates of stations at [Dugged SMP](https://redirect.dugged.net:8443/map/#Survival-Nether-Top/0/7/128/-442/64), but same can be applied to any.<br/>

### 1. Merging at our storage.
First solution doesnâ€™t go far from the existing system, just optimizes it. By going as much as possible diagonally before going straight we shorten travel time (since diagonally we travel sqrt((20^2)+(20^2)) = 28.28 m/s instead of 20 m/s).<br/>

### 2. Merging at average coordinates.
Saves us one second of average travel time!<br/>

### 3. All to All
Of course I had to try this, theoretically shortest amount of travel time.<br/>

### 4. [Travelling salesman problem. #1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)
This should find the shortest rout possible by going to each station only once. Problem is that actual solution is amount of stations factorial, so for us it is **27!**...
So first thing I tried is to just go from farthest stations from 0, 0 to closest, as you can see this is a very bad approach.<br/>
